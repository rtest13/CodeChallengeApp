# CodeChallengeApp

The application has the following features: Video Recorder along with a timer of 30 second max, video can still be stopped at any time. 
The video is saved in the internal storage where the application has the ability to playback the video via another media player application that's in the phone.
The application also displays a list of videos you recorded on the application. However, clearing the data or reinstalling will not show the list of videos anymore, only new ones from then on. 

The UI isn't designer worthy but it was the best I could do within 4-5 hours of coding. An additional 1-2 hours of research was done before starting. 

I understand that the application doesn't exactly record a square video as there isn't much libraries or information online about 1:1 custom ratios like Instagram.
With another couple hours, it could've definitely been figured out and done but I did the bonus list to make up for it. 

Hopefully it all works! 

// Note: Application needs to be Marshmellow or above because of permission issues. 
I have only tested on my personal device (Samsung S7 Edge) and a tablet from the Android emulator.
